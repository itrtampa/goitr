If the need to restore the data arises, it is readily available. This is where cloud vs. local backups come in.&nbsp;Yet many&nbsp;SMBs&nbsp;miss this critical step to protect their data \u2013 until it\u2019s too late and you\u2019ve lost it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You may have an external hard&nbsp;drive at the office, but when was the last time it connected to your computer? Do you recall your cloud storage password and does it have enough space to manage your information? This is why it\u2019s important to set up a backup routine and to use more than one type of data storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n<p><strong><em>Related Reading:<\/em><\/strong><em>&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrtampa.com\/business-benefits-backup-disaster-recovery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Benefits To Your Business: Backup and Disaster Recovery<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n<h3><strong>Cloud Vs. Local Backups<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>Both cloud and local&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrtampa.com\/backup-recovery-services\/\">backups<\/a>&nbsp;function to protect and save the data that is vital to your business. While local backup is mostly done onsite, cloud backup can be done remotely. Both are useful and have their own pros and cons,&nbsp;but that\u2019s why the hybrid storage approach is good for growing businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately what you choose will depend on your business and what you feel comfortable with. Regardless of what your business does, or its size, it is wise to develop a backup system&nbsp;that you\u2019ll stick with and use regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Let\u2019s take a look at the differences between the two:<\/em>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong><em>Local Backup<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n<p>A local backup stores data on local storage devices. Think of a local backup as something that you might have on hand in your office, such as on a hard drive, flash disk, or&nbsp;CD&nbsp;(if still on floppy disks, we need to talk). This has been used for a long time and remains quite useful to save and restore data when necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is also convenient software that can help businesses create local backups. While it is nice to have a hard copy of your data, sometimes even hard disks&nbsp;or flash disks can be damaged or compromised, so make sure to use encryption and passwords. Also, you may want to have multiple backups just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Pros:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don\u2019t need an internet connection to restore data&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Fast and easy&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Your data is free from malware attacks in your hard drive, flash disk, or CD&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Cons:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can be costly to acquire and maintain&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Storage space may be limited&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Portability or accessibility can become an issue with a physical product&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Is your business prepared to survive if data loss occurs?
