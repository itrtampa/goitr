With the prevalent use of technology in our daily lives, security is a common thread of discussion for SMBs.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><h6><em>What happens if a device is lost or stolen?<\/em><\/h6><p><em>How can you keep your business data secure when your workforce is working remotely?\u00a0<\/em>\u00a0<\/p><p>This is where encryption comes in.\u00a0Encryption\u00a0ensures that should a laptop, phone, or\u00a0 USB,\u00a0 is stolen or lost, the data is still secured.<\/p><div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\u00a0<\/div><h3><strong>How Does Mobile Encryption Work?\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h3><p>Generally, encryption protects your mission-critical data from falling into the wrong hands, should someone get\u00a0ahold\u00a0of your company\u2019s devices. Full disk encryption encrypts all the data on your storage device on a hardware level.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The data is automatically converted into something that cannot be deciphered with the key. Without the right authentication key, the data is inaccessible, even if the hard drive is put into another machine.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Mobile devices like tablets and smartphones have built-in encryption options that provide protection of storage. In this case, the encryption is done by enabling the appropriate options and\u00a0<em>adding<\/em>\u00a0an authentication key.\u00a0Keep in mind this doesn\u2019t guarantee the security of your data, the authentication key can be stolen, so it is best to limit access to these keys and have strict password policies in place!\u00a0<\/p><p><em>Make sure to have a backup and disaster recovery plan in place for your business in case of data loss!
